# DraftProspectStatCollector
A Google Apps Script program that populates a Google Sheet with up-to-date NBA Draft Prospect Data by web scraping RealGM

## The process:
1) update the starting row function
2) run the "Update Table" function that is created via the script
3) update the AB column with the link to player's RealGM player profile if there is a duplicate name in the RealGM player database
